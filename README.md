# Browser-todo-application
Second lab in web-course.
Task was to create an in-browser todo application that should be a "new tab" extension using the scaffold and Figma materials.

That I was needed to do with what I've done:

1. Todo list along with gauge is implemented according to the design provided with an ability to add a new task and mark it completed. Tasks are persisted in local storage and saved between page refreshes.
2. Remove items feature is implemented.
3. Scroll is handled properly. Scroll bar custom styles are used.
4. Empty state screens are implemented (all done and/or nothing planned).
